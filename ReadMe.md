# Gameboy for MiSTer

This is port of [Gameboy for MiST](https://github.com/mist-devel/mist-board/tree/master/cores/gameboy)

* Place RBF file into root of SD card.
* Place *.gb files into Gameboy folder.

## Open Source Bootstrap roms
This now includes the open source boot ROMs from [https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy/](https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy/) (for maximum GBC compatibility/authenticity you can still place the Gameboy color bios/bootrom into the Gameboy folder and rename it to boot1.rom)

## Palettes
Core supports custom palettes (*.gbp) which should be placed into Gameboy folder. Some examples are available in palettes folder.

## Autoload
To autoload custom palette at startup rename it to boot0.rom
To autoload favorite game at startup rename it to boot2.rom

## Video output
The Gameboy can disable video output at any time which causes problems with vsync_adjust=2 or analog video during screen transitions. Enable the Stabilize video option to fix this at the cost of some latency.
